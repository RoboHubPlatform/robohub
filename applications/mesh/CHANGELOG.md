# Changelog

All notable changes to this module are recorded here, one section per release.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-11-09

Applications can register as clients of a project, subscribe to topics and
publish messages. Mesh stores the client, its callback, its project and its
last-seen time, and routes a published message only to the clients whose
topic patterns match. Registration and publishing use a Mesh service token; callbacks carry a
per-client secret. Project settings manage one token per application: each is
scoped to the project, has its own expiry, can be copied or revoked, and does
not replace another application's token. The project list is filtered to the
projects the calling token can access. The project-context items (plan, network,
build, verify, gateway and project settings) moved from the top menu to the
bottom-left beside “Operations for …”; the top menu keeps the global items and
both settings links read simply “Settings”.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-11-08

English/Romanian UI and settings, host gateway/auth/alert/storage tabs, and
HTMX/SSE updates for the tree and actionable faults. Telemetry now bounds WAL
and retention, supports incremental/full vacuum, exposes storage status, stores
faults in a dedicated table with live events, and backs off a gateway that stops
answering.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-11-06

Security: per-project scope enforcement on all Mesh API handlers. Device HTTP
polling supports per-device bearer tokens. Recovery mode added to generated
node firmware (re-init on sensor failure). Frames no longer polluted by sensor
entries. Chart widget now handles decimal values and limited time window.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-11-05

Device telemetry follows the same descriptor model as sensors. Mesh polls HTTP
devices from `robohub-devices` using the manifest's `telemetry.http_path` and
`telemetry_http_fields`, parses the document by JSON path, scales the value, and
stores it under the device node's plan identity. A Modbus or GPIO device
publishes through its device node under the same `AREA` and `NODE`, which the
device page displays. The device source resolves to that series, and the Poll
button and switch controls are driven by the device descriptor rather than a
single Shelly model.

A node is built from every compatible module in the plan rather than from one
driver's example. Mesh copies the telemetry node template, generates
`sensors.c` from each driver's `telemetry_fields` and each board module's
`telemetry`/`signals` descriptors, and prefixes a module's field with its plan
index so two sensors measuring the same quantity on one node stay two series.
The module picker now includes output and transceiver boards too; a module with
no read path is linked and configured but contributes no reading.

Mesh keeps a telemetry store for the other RoboHub applications. A background
worker polls each project's `robohub-gateway` outbox, writes a page in one SQL
transaction, advances the project's cursor and acknowledges the sequence. The
store is SQLite in WAL mode with a series index and a latest-value table, and a
retention pass removes raw readings older than 30 days.

`/mesh/api/projects/{project}/telemetry/status`, `/latest` and `/series` serve
the store, and a source object now carries `history_path` and `history_url`. The
gateway contract gained `gateway_source_history` and `gateway_telemetry_status`,
so an application can chart a source without knowing where the reading was
stored. Mesh also passes the gateway its mode and area and records the URL of a
native gateway it starts.

The feed can require a bearer token: a project's `gateway_token` (or
`ROBOHUB_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) is sent to the outbox and passed to a gateway Mesh
starts. Retention is per project (`telemetry_retention_days`), and the store
keeps one-minute and hourly rollups after the raw rows are pruned. A network
device's readings are matched to the id the gateway assigned it by the device's
name and address in the plan.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-11-04

Mesh signs browser users in through Keeper and accepts signed service JWTs for /mesh/api, so Aquarium server-to-server calls keep working with authentication enforced.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-11-03

Mesh has the same visual language as the Aquarium: a photographic background,
a fixed top bar for the operations and documentation, and a fixed bottom bar
that names the active project and lists the workspace's projects. The left
menu is gone.

The plan, build and network tree is now the centerpiece: a branching graph of
frosted cards connected by the transport on each branch, with the gateway at
the root. Node, module and device cards keep their role, board and status
information.

Form pages — node, module, device, gateway, project settings and the guide —
are wrapped in the same frosted panel, so the background never shows through
their labels and tables.

Accepting a topology no longer treats a module or a device as an incomplete
compute node: only compute nodes are asked for a role, board and link. A
free-standing device now branches from the gateway beside the relay nodes
instead of stacking under the first branch. Deleting a node also carries a
device's integration, transport, address and network settings to the row that
takes its place.

The dashboard now shows the last gateway action. A failed restart is a red
notice with the tail of the build output and the gateway log, and a restart
pins the build step so that output is captured in the file the notice reads.

A project publishes its signals for another application: devices, modules and
sensors each contribute the inputs and outputs their `signals:` contract names,
with direction, unit and the widget kinds they can feed. The values are served
by Mesh, which reads the project's gateway, so a dashboard does not need the
gateway address or a part's type.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-11-03

The gateway belongs to a project, not to the Mesh application. A project's
settings carry its gateway URL; `/mesh/api/projects` lists the projects,
`/mesh/api/projects/{project}/gateway` serves that project's gateway while it
answers, and `/mesh/api/devices` serves its device nodes.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-11-03

Mesh settings name the gateway URL; `/mesh/api/gateway` serves it while the
gateway answers, and `/mesh/api/devices` serves the device nodes. Another
application can connect to Mesh and discover where the devices are.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-11-03

A device can be **free standing**: its parent is the mesh/network rather than a
gateway or relay. It appears at the root of the tree, is not carried by a node,
and is reached directly over its own transport.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-11-02

Device picker reads the `devices:` list in robohub-devices' module.yml, so
every device the collection carries is offered and a new one appears on the next
render. The transport list includes Modbus, GPIO and UART alongside HTTP and
MQTT.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-11-02

Device nodes are reachable from the tree and from a native gateway too:
"+ Add device" is beside "+ Add node", and a compute node offers "+ device"
beside "+ module". A native host can carry network devices even though it has
no pins for modules.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-02

Device nodes. A device from `robohub-devices` is a node of its own in the Mesh
tree, attached to a gateway or a relay; it is not built or programmed. The
editor discovers device integrations from the checkout; the Shelly Plug M Gen3
is the first, over HTTP RPC or MQTT. An HTTP device can be polled and switched
from its node page; an MQTT device is carried by its relay or gateway.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-02

A node is one computer, and a sensor module is a node of its own (`kind: module`)
attached to it, rather than a field on the node. Module nodes appear in the plan
tree under the node they extend, are added with **+ Add module** or **+ module**,
and are never built or programmed separately: the node's image carries them. A
native gateway cannot take modules; the controls appear only when the gateway is
a real board.

The module picker is read from `robohub-drivers/boards` on every load, grouped by
board category. Each module declares its bus and, where it matters, its I2C
address, address range or SPI chip select; the node page shows the resulting bus
plan. 1-Wire and I2C lines are shared, an SPI device gets its own chip select,
and an address or exclusive instance that is already in use is reported and left
out of the image so the parent node always builds. The attached modules are
linked into the node's image.

A failed plan, build or verify action raises an alert through the application's
configured dispatcher. The local log channel is enabled by default; e-mail,
Telegram and webhook channels are declared but disabled until configured.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-01

The RoboHub Mesh application, extracted from the keeper. It runs on its own
port and is either started directly or launched from the keeper's applications
registry, where it declares `kind: keeper-hosted`.

It plans a gateway and its nodes, records each project in a workspace folder,
configures the connections between them, builds and programs the firmware, and
verifies the running deployment. Boards, drivers and transports are discovered
from the local registry at runtime.

The application has its own left menu: Dashboard, the active project's
operations, every project in the workspace, and its documentation. A project is
activated by opening it, from its card or from its settings, and made inactive
again from the same places; with no active project the Operations group is
hidden and the step pages return to the dashboard. The menu also returns to the
keeper when the keeper started the application.
